## How to play
You are playing as Sam Fisher, and you need to make a clean escape from the enemies (or rather defeat them so they can stop trying to get revenge for Tom Reed). You can use the WASD keys or the arrow keys to move around. You are not able escape outside the border or you risk getting caught.

## Original Purpose
This project was meant to be a quick surprise but fun application for my significant other who enjoys Splinter Cell Games.
I don't know much about the game but I gathered little pieces of information to put together a scheme.
So he would complete the entire game, which finishes at score 100 and he would have won a game redemption code for steam.

## What Now (Things I am possibly working on)
I am interested in any advice for this game. It could definitely use a lot of touches.
This is mostly for hobby purposes/practice.
For example:
- Text Alignment
- Cleaner code
- Making the score text also have a border that cannot be passed [ at the moment, you can walk over the score text as if its just an overlay ]
In particular my most issue was with the pixels on the screen. I wanted to make the snake bigger but it would not interact with the enemy correctly when I made the sizes bigger.
And anything else that could be thought of to make this look better than it does
