## Original Purpose
This project was meant to be a quick surprise but fun application for my significant other who enjoys Splinter Cell Games.
I don't know much about the game but I gathered little pieces of information to put together a scheme.
So he would complete the entire game, which finishes at score 100 and he would have won a game redemption code for steam.

## What Now
I am interested in any advice for this game. It could definitely use a lot of touches.
For example:
- Text Alignment
- Cleaner code
And anything else that could be thought of to make this look better than it does
